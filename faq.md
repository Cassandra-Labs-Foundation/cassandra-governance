# FAQ

### The bylaws state “The association is organized exclusively for charitable, educational, and scientific purposes.” This statement could apply to any charitable association. What are the opportunities for members to participate in these charitable, educational, and scientific purposes? And what are these charitable, educational, and scientific purposes?

Cassandra Labs designs, builds, and stewards public-goods infrastructure—software, research, and open standards usable by anyone. Collective intelligence means improving how groups generate and aggregate knowledge (e.g., forecasting/replication markets, negotiation experiments, expert review). Mechanism design means creating and testing incentive systems and rules (e.g., auctions, matching, scoring rules, staking/attestation) that steer behavior toward reliable, pro-social outcomes. **We develop open-source tools, run studies with those tools, publish what we learn, and operate or partner to operate reference implementations for public use.**

**Core activities**

1. **Open-source software:** maintain repos, accept member contributions, host sprints and security reviews.
2. **Research & studies:** design, run, and participate in **surveys and experiments** using our software to produce datasets that inform **mechanism design decisions** and research outputs.
3. **Publications & standards:** **author and publish** academic and working papers, plus **public reports and best-practice guides** openly shared with the community.
4. **Education & events:** **attend or help organize** our **quarterly workshops** or **annual meeting**, which feature invited talks from leading researchers, scientists, and project creators.
5. **Public-interest legal/policy research:** explainers and comment letters to help regulators track contemporary fintech developments and craft workable frameworks.

**How members participate (annual expectation)** — do **at least one** each year:

* **Complete or help run a research survey** or study (participant, moderator, or data helper).
* Contribute to publications (drafting, co-authoring, reviewing, or supplying analysis/data).
* Contribute open-source work (code, docs, tests, issue triage, security review).
* Provide domain expertise to help design/evaluate our tools and standards.
* Support legal/policy work (draft explainers or comment letters for agencies).

We keep simple records of participation and dues to verify eligibility and good standing for CU onboarding.

### What are the Mission-Related Activities that Members can participate in?&#x20;

&#x20;The “mission-related activities” in our bylaws are the standing programs we sponsor and run:

As outlined in [#the-bylaws-state-the-association-is-organized-exclusively-for-charitable-educational-and-scientific](faq.md#the-bylaws-state-the-association-is-organized-exclusively-for-charitable-educational-and-scientific "mention"), our association-sponsored programs include an open-source program (issue triage, contributor sprints, code review, documentation, and security reviews) and a research pipeline where members serve as researchers, analysts, or testers and also participate in research surveys and experiments using Association software, with results feeding mechanism design decisions and papers. Members draft, co-author, peer-review, and disseminate publications—papers, public reports, and best-practice guides—and they attend or help organize our quarterly workshops and annual meeting, which feature invited talks from leading researchers, scientists, and project creators. We also charter topic-specific advisory committees and working groups under Article 5.3 to advise (without binding) the Association, support policy and public-interest work through comment letters, regulator explainers, and comparative analyses, and conduct agenda setting via ranked-choice voting at quarterly meetings to prioritize the research agenda and standards roadmap.

We have already published papers (we shared those last month but let me know if you’d like more copies) and hosted several presentations by leading researchers and project creators; we can provide the paper list and recent agendas on request.
